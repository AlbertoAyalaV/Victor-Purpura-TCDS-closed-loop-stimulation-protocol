### Please read this (and delete) before posting:

For your posts, we ask (but don't require) you do provide the following information when appropriate:

1. **The version of RTXI you are using.**  If you used a live CD to install RTXI, just say that. If you compiled from source, go to your clone of the RTXI repository and run `git log`. The most recent commit will have a string associated with it that looks like a random list of letters. Give us the string.
2. **Error messages from RTXI in the terminal.** If there are no error messages, no problem. If RTXI is crashing, it would be incredibly helpful if you used `gdb` to provide a backtrace.
3. **A clear description of the bug.** Describe the behavior you expect, the behavior that is happening, and the set of steps that trigger the error.

Clear issue postings are incredibly helpful for us to start debugging your issues, and it also helps anyone else fully understand the issues you have.
